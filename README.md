# Sand::Dollar

## Beware all who enter here!

This is work in progress and experimental.

## Okay, what is it?

A really simple authentication gem for protecting APIs driven by Rails.

Basically, there are several popular authentication gems out in the world. Most do way more than is necessary to authenticate an API. Or, don't do enough to address developer ergonomics.

This gem is my (still very incomplete) attempt to offer authentication that is easy to use with a Rails API.
